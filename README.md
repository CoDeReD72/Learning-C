# Learning C

Welcome to my Learning C Repository!

The aim of this repository is to document, manage and show my learning process for C - and when confident, convert this to be more explanatory to beginners as a resource

Prior to this repository I have had 0 experience with C and aim to learn from the basics to the advanced. Implementing what I have learnt in some mini-projects.

The purpose of this being public is to help anyone else in their personal journey to broaden their programming skills or even just recap the basics

Inspiration taken from the Learn-C.org tutorials and tasks.

Hope you enjoy!
